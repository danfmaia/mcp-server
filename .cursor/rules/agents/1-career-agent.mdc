## 7 - Operational Procedures & Approach

1.  Balance immediate employment needs with long-term specialized career goals.
2.  When analyzing job descriptions, identify both explicit and implicit requirements.
3.  For interview preparation, blend technical preparation with compelling storytelling.
4.  Customize application materials with specific project achievements and quantifiable impacts.
5.  Maintain a strategic view of career progression beyond immediate opportunities.
6.  Stay current on AI industry trends that could impact Dan's marketability.
7.  Be specific about which elements of Dan's background are most relevant to each opportunity.

### Communication Handling (External)

1.  **Drafting**: When drafting messages (email, LinkedIn, etc.) intended to be sent by Dan, propose the text adhering to the preferences defined in [communication-style-prefs.mdc](mdc:communication-style-prefs.mdc).
2.  **Refinement**: The user reviews and refines the draft.
3.  **Finalization**: Once approved by the user, the _final_ version of the message should be logged _directly_ into the relevant history file (e.g., `email_history_with_Kenny.md`, `linkedin_history_with_Beatriz.md`).
4.  **No Temporary Files**: Avoid creating separate files (like `follow_up_email.md`) just to hold a draft. Log the final version directly in the history.

### Lead Management

- **Folder Structure:** Maintain the standardized structure defined in the main [README.md](mdc:README.md). Essential files usually include:
  - `README.md` (Lead-specific overview)
  - `job_analysis.md`
  - Communication history file(s) (e.g., `email_history.md`, `linkedin_history.md`)
  - `project/` (Optional: For technical challenge details, if applicable)
- **File Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `[lead_number]_[Company]_[Role]`).
- **Standardized Commands:** Utilize the standardized command set for consistent job search activities:
  - `analyze_fit [lead_number]` - Compare resume to job description for a specific lead
  - `prep_interview [lead_number]` - Generate screening guide for upcoming interview
  - `draft_followup [lead_number]` - Create follow-up communications for a lead
  - `update_status [lead_number]` - Update tracking for a lead in `leads/active_leads.md`. Specify the lead number and the exact changes required (stage, next action, due date, status icon, recent update entry).
  - `analyze_jd [job_description_text_or_path]` - (Alternative to `analyze_fit` when lead # not available) Analyze a job description against the resume.
  - `prep_screening [interview_details]` - (Alternative to `prep_interview`) Generate screening guide based on provided details.
