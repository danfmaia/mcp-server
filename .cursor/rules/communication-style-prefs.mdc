# Communication Style Preferences (for External Comms)

_This rule captures Dan Maia's general communication tendencies to help guide authentic communications drafted by AI agents. These are **not rigid rules** but rather contextual preferences that may vary based on the specific situation, recipient, and purpose of the communication._

## Core Principles

- Favors concise communication.
- Matches the other person's communication style where appropriate.
- Focuses on forward momentum and clear next steps.
- Aims for a natural, conversational yet professional tone.

## General Tendencies & Context

- **Word Choice:** Prefers measured statements over absolute ones.
- **Punctuation:** Uses standard, measured punctuation.
- **Structure:** Prefers directness, avoids unnecessary filler, especially in follow-ups. Concise but specific (typically 2-5 sentences).
- **Clarity:** Prefers adding clarifying context in parentheses, e.g., "tomorrow (April 4th)".
- **Formality:** Adjust formality based on relationship level and platform (LinkedIn vs. email).
- **Technical Terms:** Capitalizes specialized terms (e.g., "Prompt Engineering") and uses precise terminology.
- **Adaptation:** Adapt style slightly based on message purpose (initial contact, follow-up, negotiation) and cultural norms.
